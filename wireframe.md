# Wireframe Prompts for StorySpark AI Progressive Web App

## 🎯 General Design Instruction Prompt

> **Prompt**:
> "Design a voice-first progressive web app (PWA) for children aged 3–12 and their parents, called *StorySpark AI*. The experience should feel warm, magical, and culturally grounded in Indian aesthetics. Use large touch targets, calming colors, and voice as the primary interface. No typing required. Key features include: AI-generated audio stories, co-creation prompts for kids, a parent dashboard with insights, offline download support, and regional language localization. Prioritize accessibility, offline resilience, and intuitive flow for both kids and adults."

## 🧒🏽 1. Child Home Screen – “Granny, Tell Me a Story”

> **Prompt**:
> "Create a child-facing home screen titled 'Hi, I’m Dadi Maa!'. There should be a large central button: **‘Tell me a story’**, which begins the voice interaction. Include a small animated ‘listening’ indicator (like a pulsing ear or glowing ring) when listening. Add two smaller options: **‘Make my own story’** and **‘Tell me about \[today’s virtue]’**. Use warm Indian motifs, gentle music cues, and minimal text. Visuals should imply storytelling magic but avoid distractions (no videos or bright colors)."

## 🎤 2. Voice Interaction Flow – Story Listening Mode

> **Prompt**:
> "Design the story listening interface. When a story plays, show a warm, dim background with subtle animations (like glowing stars or a flickering diya). Include simple voice control icons: **pause**, **stop**, and **‘ask a question’**. Visually show story progress (e.g., dots or scroll bar). The child can interrupt by speaking. Display the current story title and character names in large fonts. Add a tiny 'co-created by \[child’s name]' badge if it’s a custom story."

## 🧠 3. Co-Creation Flow – Story Wizard

> **Prompt**:
> "Design a 2-step co-creation wizard for children to generate a personalized story. Step 1: Ask them via voice prompts to choose a character, setting, or object. Step 2: Confirm their voice inputs with visuals (e.g., 'You said: a tiger in the jungle'). Then display a 'Ready?' button to start the AI storytelling. Use fun icons, sound effects, and clear voice feedback to keep the experience engaging. No keyboard input should be necessary."

## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 4. Parent Dashboard – Progress + Preferences

> **Prompt**:
> "Design a clean, accessible dashboard for parents. Show weekly listening time, story themes covered (e.g., kindness, honesty), and languages used. Include settings to: choose story length, preferred language(s), bedtime timer, and daily moral theme. Add a 'Download for offline' button and alerts for upcoming festivals with themed stories. Use soft colors, elegant typography, and icons to create a trustworthy, calm tone."

---

## 🌐 5. Onboarding Screen (Parents + Kids)

> **Prompt**:
> "Create a joint onboarding experience for parents and kids. Step 1: Parent chooses child’s age, language(s), and bedtime preferences. Step 2: Child gets to 'name their storyteller' (e.g., Dadi, Nani, Chacha, etc.). Step 3: Audio tutorial begins with an engaging, voiced character welcoming them. Display avatars, a big 'Let’s Begin' button, and skip options for impatient kids. Keep layout touch-friendly and story-like."

---

## 📱 6. Offline Story Library

> **Prompt**:
> "Design an offline-accessible story library with cover thumbnails, duration, and themes. Include filters: 'My Favorites', 'Festive Stories', 'By Virtue', 'Short (5-min)', and 'Long (15-min)'. Use cards with play/download icons and gentle visuals. Clicking a story should autoplay it in the voice player. Clearly indicate which stories are downloaded vs. available online."

## 📦 Optional: Dev Handoff Notes Prompt

> **Prompt**:
> "Export this wireframe with detailed component specs for handoff to front-end engineers. Annotate all buttons, voice inputs, and screen transitions. Provide responsive layouts for mobile-first design (min 360px width) and fallback desktop PWA view. Prioritize offline resilience, minimal bandwidth consumption, and accessibility (voice-only + screen reader-friendly)."
